<h1>Oregon Outdoor Library</h1>

<h2><img src="Images/OverviewIcon.png" alt="OV Icon" height="100" width="100"> <em>Overview</em></h2>
<p>The idea for this site/app came to me while driving with my wife
    through the neighborhoods in my surrounding area. While doing so, we
    noticed that many neighborhoods have constructed multiple miniature
    outdoor library's for the nearby people to use as a free book share.

    Seeing this I thought about how, with my knowledge of code, I could create an app or website,
    that would allow the members of the communities that use these book shares, to connect with
    one another, as well as keep track of what each book share may have in stock.

<h3><img src="Images/ShortTerm.png" alt="ShortTerm Icon" height="100" width="100"><em>Short Term</em></h3>
<p>The immediate goals of this site are to create as accurate of a database of locations and
    books as possible for the communities. This along with app and website feedback will help
    to calibrate everything as we go along.

<h4><img src="Images/LongTerm.png" alt="LongTerm Icon" height="100" width="100"><em>Long Term</em></h4>
<p>In the larger picture, this neighborhood book share idea was the people's creation! So in light
    of that, I will aim to aid the neighborhoods in keeping this a community ran on a self-sufficient
    system allowing this activity to <strong>"stay as technology free as possible"</strong> while still being able to
    connect with others that have like-minded hobbies and gather information in a timely manner.
